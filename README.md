# Welcome to my NFT Collection Whitelist Dapp

This is my second DApp and a continuation of the Learn Web3 series from the https://learnweb3.io tracks.

This Whitelist DApp is built with Solidity (for the smart contract), React, and Next.js (for the frontend and backend interactions).

It is a simple DApp with the following features:
1. Allows users to connect their wallet.
2. Notify them if they are not on the Rinkeby network by throwing an error message.
3. Checks if a user's address has been whitelisted, if not, then renders the "Join The Whitelist" button.
4. Changes the button text to "Confirming..." while the transaction is being mined.
5. Displays a success message to show that your address has been whitelisted.
6. Informs a user that the maximum limit of whitelisted addresses has been reached by throwing a predefined error message.

I hope to improve it over time as I learn more, or release a V2 with better UI and added functions in the smart contract (e.g a function to show each whitelisted address).

Thank you for checking this out. As always, I welcome suggestions and help.
